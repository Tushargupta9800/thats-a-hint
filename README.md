## Introduction

* Cryptocurrency exchange is a business that allows customers to trade their cryptocurrency for other assets for example conventional fiat money or other digital currencies. <br/>
* In our project we have assigned two hypothetical coins (namely: pumpcoin and napcoin; 1pumpcoin = 10napcoins) to each account running on the blockchain. 
* * Users would be able to exchange their assets across the accounts using the account address. 
* * Users would also be able to check their balance

## Features available for the project

* We have created two ERC20 tokens: Pumpcoin and Napcoin
* * 1 Pumpcoin = 10 Napcoins
* The deployed contract holds funds of both the type of tokens - pumpcoin and napcoin. The idea is similar to farms/pools in currently implemented decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap and Pancakeswap. Users can interchange tokens of one type with other type through the deployed contract.
* User can exchange N Pumpcoins with 10*N Napcoins 
* And N Napcoins with 0.1*N Pumpcoin
* Users can also check their account balance i.e. the amount of pumpcoins and napcoins
